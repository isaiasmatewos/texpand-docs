To create a shortcut open Texpand and tap the plus button at the bottom right corner, then tap "phrase" to create a phrase.

## Creating a phrase list

Phrase lists allow you to create a list of snippets that can be displayed by typing one shortcut, for example you could create a list of replies to send quickly when you're busy. 

Then you can type the shortcut and choose from the list of replies.

Phrase list is part of Texpand Premium.

## Shortcut name restrictions

- Shortcuts must be alphanumeric including unicode characters, 
- Allowed symbols: ``*~^=+/\%'`&[](){}"<>?!-_,.@#$;:``
- Shortcuts can't contain emojis ☹️
- Shortcuts can't have spaces

## Using your shortcuts 

Once you have created your shortcuts you can use them in many apps, unfortunately Texpand is not compatible with every app, please refer to this page to learn more about Texpand's limitations and how you can overcome them.

You can also trigger text expansion by adding punctuation characters such as `,.:;?` after the shortcut, the punctuation character used to trigger the expansion will be appended to the end of the snippet.

To undo the expansion you can tap the backspace key in your keyboard.

## Snippet suggestions

If you have a lot of shortcuts remembering all of them can be difficult, Texpand can help you find them without having to remember ther exact spelling. 


If what you're typing matches part of one or more shortcuts Texpand will display a small search icon, tapping it will display a list of shortcuts similar to the word you just typed.

Tap the desired shortcut to insert it.

## Opening your snippets with other apps

If your snippet is a type of text that can be handled by another app such as a link, email, or telephone number you can easily open it by tapping the app icon the appears besides the snippet preview. 

For example if you call a specific number frequently you can create a shortcut for it and dial directly from any app by typing the shortcut and tapping the dialer icon the will appear in the snippet preview window, this will save you a lot of taps and time. 

This feature is only available on Android 8 Oreo or later.
