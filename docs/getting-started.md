## Opening your phrases with other applications

If your phrase is something that can be opened by another application such as link or phone number, you can open it from any other app that you're working on by tapping the icon that appears besides the phrase.

For example: If you have a shortcut for a phone number, you can call directly from any app that you're working on by typing the shortcut and tapping the dialer icon that appears in the phrase preview window, this will save you lots of taps and time. 

This feature is only available on Android 8 Oreo or later.
